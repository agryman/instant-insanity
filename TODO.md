* 2025-07-17 check if OpenGL renders my graph construction scene correctly
* 2025-07-17 reread the Manim CE Deep Dive docs and try to understand the processing sequence and how 3D is handled
* 2025-07-17 check if my perpetual fallback licence for IntelliJ is usable for Python development
* 2025-07-14 animate a cube morphing into a graph
* 2025-07-06 understand Manim Text. How does it work in 3D scenes?
* 2025-07-03 write a script to compute the running time of all voiceovers


## Ideas

* 2025-07-18 cubes are simple 3d objects so it may be more productive to manually compute their 2d projects and use 2d scenes instead of 3d scenes
