# instant-insanity

Animation showing how to solve Instant Insanity using Graph Theory.

## Google Colab

This project contains Jupyter notebooks.
It is convenient to run these notebooks in Google Colab which at present
uses Python 3.11.11.
The code in this project will therefore run in Python 3.11.11.

I've installed Python 3.11.11 using homebrew on my Mac.
To invoke Python 3.11.11, I use the following command:

```shell
/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.11/bin/python3.11
```
