    "## Arthur's Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "My motivation is to continue the tradition of sharing mathematical gems with the next generation.\n",
    "The gem I want to share is the graph theory solution to the Instant Insanity puzzle.\n",
    "It was shared with me by a mathematics professor when I was a high school student.\n",
    "Aside from this gem being very enjoyable, it had a significant\n",
    "influence on my subsequent academic and professional career.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was a high school student during the Instant Insanity puzzle craze of 1967. \n",
    "The puzzle consists of four cubes whose faces are coloured red, green, blue, and white.\n",
    "The pattern of colours looks random.\n",
    "You have to line up the cubes so no colour was repeated on each row of four faces.\n",
    "The number of possible combinations is very high - we'll compute the exact number later.\n",
    "\n",
    "My high school, Northview Heights Secondary School in North York, Toronto was unusual in that it had its own IBM 1130 computer.\n",
    "Computer Science was not even on the cirriculum back then, but \n",
    "one of our teachers, Mr. Wong, ran classes after school and taught us how to program in Fortran 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having been unable to solve Instant Insanity by hand, I decided to write a Fortran program to find the solution by\n",
    "doing a brute-force search.\n",
    "I wrote the program, keypunched it, loaded the cards into the reader, hit the Start button, \n",
    "and expected to see the solution promptly emerge on the line printer.\n",
    "To my great dissappointment, the line printer remained silent. \n",
    "Instead, all I heard was the motion of the disk drive arms moving back and forth. \n",
    "I had never experienced a program that had spent so much time thinking.\n",
    "I thought maybe the number of combinations was so high that the program would never finish.\n",
    "But after a few minutes I heard the line printer start up and hammer out the solution.\n",
    "I tore the paper off the printer, pulled out my cubes, and confirmed that the program had indeed found the solution.\n",
    "I was elated, but then a little disappointed.\n",
    "Was that all there was? Just apply enough brute force and you'll solve the puzzle?\n",
    "\n",
    "That wasn't the end of the story.\n",
    "One day a year or so later we were told that our math class was cancelled because we were having a special guest\n",
    "speaker in the auditorium.\n",
    "The speaker was [Prof. Ross Honsberger](https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/professor-ross-honsberger), \n",
    "University of Waterloo, Faculty of Mathematics, Department of Combinatorics and Optimization.\n",
    "Prof. Honsberger talked to us about several topics, including graph theory.\n",
    "He closed by using graph theory to produce an extremely elegant solution to the Instant Insanity puzzle!\n",
    "I was blown away by its elegance and ingenuity.\n",
    "In the months following that lecture, I showed the solution to any of my friends who were interested in the puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast forward fifty years to the Internet and YouTube. \n",
    "Who would have thought that there would be an audience for math explainer videos?\n",
    "What a perfect medium for sharing the solution to Instant Insanity!\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast forward to the present.\n",
    "I have finally retired and can spend time on my bucket list.\n",
    "By a stroke of pure luck I have been reconnected with Will owing to our shared past\n",
    "at York University centered around computer graphics. \n",
    "Will went on to become a CGI professional.\n",
    "When I asked Will if he could give me some pointers on animation, he graciously offered to collaborate.\n",
    "So here we are, ready to produce a video."

    "## Prior Art\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a general rule that if you have what seems like a good idea then the odds are high that someone has already thought of it and has acted on it.\n",
    "I therefore did an Internet search and found several YouTube videos.\n",
    "A few of these (2008, 2016) are simply videos of people explaining the solution using standard presentation aids but no animation.\n",
    "A couple (2018, 2019) are more recent and use simple animation such as might be implemented using PowerPoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [2018 video](https://youtu.be/Lw1pF47N-0Q) was an episode of PBS Infinite Series, written and narrated by [Tai-Danae Bradley](https://www.math3ma.com/about) who is a skilled content creator.\n",
    "This is the one to beat.\n",
    "If we can't significantly improve on it then there is no point in continuing this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "I do think we can advance the state-of-the-art in several aspects.\n",
    "These are explained next."

    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "* the target audience is math enthusiasts, especially young ones who don't have formal math training\n",
    "* the video should be very self-contained - it should explain all terms\n",
    "* the video should be easy to follow - it should NOT require any mental leaps\n",
    "* the video should be visually appealling\n",
    "* the video should take advantage of the fact that cubes are physical objects by realistically rendering them as such\n",
    "* the video should use exploit 3D graphics to achieve visual continuity as one representation is morphed into another\n",
    "* the video should explain the combinatorics of the puzzle, NOT simply quote the number of combinations\n",
    "* the video should explain graph theory in the context of the puzzle and animate the transformation of the puzzle into a graph\n",
    "* the video should explain the history of the puzzle and show the original graph theory solution published in 1947\n",
    "* the video should animate the search trees for both the physical cubes and the abstract graph\n",
    "* the video should explain the concept of abstraction and show how the graph abstracts the physical cubes\n",
    "* the video should not be too long - no boring content\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe include some history of graph theory:\n",
    "* invented by Leonhard Euler in 1736 to solve the\n",
    "[Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg) puzzle\n",
    "* there are several YouTube videos but we could do a better animation of morphing the map of the bridges into the graph\n",
    "* another nice example is the map of the London Underground which makes the connectivity clearer at the expanse of distorting the physical distances between stations\n",
    "    * we could also morph the map into the graph\n",
    "\n",
    "It may also be of interest to include some background info, possibly as a separate video.\n",
    "* the 1947 solution was discovered by Bill Tutte and friends at Cambridge\n",
    "* Bill Tutte became a codebreaker during the war\n",
    "* Bill Tutte became an eminent graph theorist (the subject of his PhD thesis)\n",
    "* Bill Tutte moved to Canada and became a founding member of the University of Waterloo, Combinatorics and Optimization Dept.\n",
    "* the Government of Canada named a research institute after him [Tutte Institute for Mathematics and Computing](https://www.cse-cst.gc.ca/en/mission/research-cse/tutte-institute-mathematics-computing)\n",
    "* Ross Honsberger got a math degree from University of Toronto, taught high school math, and became Head of the Math Department at Northview Heights\n",
    "* Ross Honsberger left Northview Heights and joined the University of Waterloo, Combinatorics and Optimization Dept. where he most certainly worked with Bill Tutte\n",
    "* Ross Honsberger wrote 13 books on mathematical puzzles and recreations\n",
    "* it seems likely that Bill Tutte showed Ross Honsberger the graph theory solution to the puzzle\n",
    "* University of Waterloo was developing a strong reputation in Computer Science\n",
    "* [IBM provided computers to UW](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/40th/Chronology/printable.shtml) and hired many of its CS co-op students\n",
    "* it seems plausible that Ross Honsberger advocated for putting the IBM 1130 computer in NHSS\n",
    "* it seems plausible that Ross Honsberger was a guest speaker at NHSS because he was formerly the Head of the Math Department\n",
    "* therefore we most likely have a direct causal chain from Bill Tutte to Ross Honsberger/IBM to Northview Heights to Arthur/Will to you the viewer\n",
    "* we could present these events and relations as a graph!"
