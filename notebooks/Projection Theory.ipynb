    "\n",
    "Our goal is to draw 3d objects, such as cubes, in math animations using Manim.\n",
    "At first I attempted to use the ThreeDScene class and OpenGL renderer.\n",
    "I assumed that the OpenGL renderer would draw 3d objects correctly through the use of\n",
    "a z-buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, I ran into othed problems with OpenGL which I reported to the \n",
    "Manim Community Edition project.\n",
    "Work is in-progress there to produce a high-quality OpenGL renderer but it does not seem ready\n",
    "yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "I therefore reverted to using the Scene class and Cairo renderer\n",
    "As I workaround, I developed code that projects 3d objects onto 2d space and depth-sorts them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of my planned content is 2d, so using the Scene class and Cairo\n",
    "in conjunction with projections and depth-sorting is an acceptable short-term workaround.\n",
    "Furthermore, the Cairo renderer is very stable and the vast majority of the Manim examples use it.\n",
    "Cairo is therefore a safer bet until the OpenGL renderer is ready."

    "### Depth-Sorting\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above, our goal is to draw 3d objects as 2d objects in a way that conveys\n",
    "the appearance of depth.\n",
    "For example, a 3d cube consists of six square faces. \n",
    "We project each square face from 3d to 2d.\n",
    "In general, each projected face will no longer be a square.\n",
    "Instead, the projection will transform each face into\n",
    "some quadrilateral whose interior angles are no longer right angles and \n",
    "whose sides are no longer equal. \n",
    "The projection distorts the square in a way that is consistent our depth perception.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to projecting the faces of the cube, we need to draw them on $C$ \n",
    "in the correct order so as to achieve the desired visual appearance.\n",
    "If face A is behind face B in $M$ then we need to draw the 2d projection\n",
    "of face A on $C$ before we draw that of face B. \n",
    "Part of the projection of face B may cover part of the projection of face A, \n",
    "reproducing the actual visual appearance.\n",
    "This drawing procedure is known as the \n",
    "[Painter's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painter%27s_algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will assume that our 3d objects can be modelled as \n",
    "collections of opaque, convex, planar polygons and \n",
    "that we can always sort them into some drawing order that will produce the correct visual appearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to sort the polygons is a strong assumption.\n",
    "It is possible to arrange as few as three nonintersecting, convex, \n",
    "planar polygons in a way that has no corresponding correct drawing order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the known requirements for our current animation project, \n",
    "all collections of 3d objects will be simple enough that a correct\n",
    "drawing order always exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we actually needed to draw some collection of polygons that had no correct drawing order,\n",
    "then we would have to split some of the polygons.\n",
    "If we split the polygons enough then a correct drawing order always exists.\n",
    "In the extreme case, we could split each polygon into individual pixels.\n",
    "We'll defer dealing with this situation until project requirements force us to do so."
