    "The Coloured Cubes Problem, which we call Instant Insanity,\n",
    "appeared as early as 1900 under the name Tantalizer, yet Carteblanche's ingeneous solution\n",
    "only appeared many years later in 1947.\n",
    "Given that it took at least 47 years for someone to discover this solution,\n",
    "it is safe to say that it was certainly not obvious.\n",
    "So how was it discovered and who discovered it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Carteblanche was the pseudonym of four Cambridge mathematics students, one of whom was Bill Tutte, \n",
    "a graph theory researcher who later became a world-reknown figure in that subject.\n",
    "It seems highly likely that Tutte was the one who realized that the opposite-face colourings could be elegantly \n",
    "represented as a labelled multigraph and used to solve the puzzle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tutte's university studies were interrupted by World War II during which he worked as a codebreaker\n",
    "at the legendary Bletchley Park. \n",
    "Tutte successfully cracked the extremely difficult Lorenz cipher, codenamed Tunny.\n",
    "Although Alan Turing's decryption of the Enigma code has been widely popularized,\n",
    "for example in the movie The Imitation Game, \n",
    "Tutte's work on Lorenz was kept secret by the British Government.\n",
    "Many experts consider Tutte's cracking of Lorenz to have been much more impressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2011 BBC documentary, Code-Breakers: Bletchley Park's Lost Heroes,\n",
    "describes Bill Tutte's remarkable code-breaking achievement as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2025 BBC documentary, Physicist Brian Cox Explains How Isaac Newton Invented Modern Science,\n",
    "has this to say about Tutte's approach to cracking Lorenz.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, Bill Tutte was a genious of the first rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is tempting to speculate that Tutte's intensive mental concentration on the Lorenz cipher prepared his mind to\n",
    "solve the Coloured Cubes Problem.\n",
    "Both the Enigma and Lorenz machines had at their core a row of rotating wheels called rotors whose initial\n",
    "positions were set to a secret, shared encryption key. \n",
    "The sender and receiver had to set their rotors to the same encryption key in order to successfully\n",
    "encrypt and decrypt a message. \n",
    "Since the number of possible rotor settings was astronomically large, it was virtually\n",
    "impossible for anyone who intercepted the encrypted message to try all possible rotor settings \n",
    "in an effort to decrypt it.\n",
    "The similarity between a row of rotors and a row of rotating cubes may have attracted Tutte to the puzzle.\n",
    "Compared to cracking Lorenz, solving the puzzle must have seemed like child's play to him. \n",
    "\n",
    "After graduating from Cambridge Tutte joined the faculty of the \n",
    "Department of Combinatorics and Optimization at the University of Waterloo in Canada where\n",
    "he made many fundamental discoveries in graph theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Canadian Government Communications Security Establishment, which carries on highly classified\n",
    "cryptography research, named the Tutte Institute for Mathematics and Computing in his honour."
