What led Carteblanche to use graph theory in The Coloured Cubes Problem?

The Trinity Four were skilled users of graph theory as early as 1940
as is evident from their paper on The Dissection of Rectangles into Squares published under their real names.

This problem was inspired by puzzle #40, Lady Isabel's Casket in Dudeney's 1908 book The Cantebury Puzzles.
This puzzle describes a square casket inlaid with squares, all of different
dimensions, and one gold rectangle with given dimensions.
The puzzle challenges you to find the dimensions of the casket and all the squares.

Problems of this type became known as Squaring the Square.
