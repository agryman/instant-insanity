Bill Tutte, Leonard Brooks, Arthur Stone, and Cedric Smith met in 1935 as undergraduates at 
Trinity College, Cambridge University. 
They formed a collaboration known as the Trinity Four based on their 
shared interest in mathematical puzzles.

The Trinity Four published many papers together, 
mostly in the Cambridge Mathematical Society journal Eureka, writing under the pseudonym Blanche Descarte.

Blanche Descarte later acquired a husband known variously as Filet de Carte Blanche or F. de Carteblanche,
the author of the 1947 Coloured Cubes paper which is our main object of interest here.
Filet is the French word for net which is short for network, providing further evidence that
graph theory was very much on their minds.
