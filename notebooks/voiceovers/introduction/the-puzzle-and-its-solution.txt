The Instant Insanity puzzle consists of four cubes whose faces are coloured either red, white, blue, or green.
The object of the puzzle is to arrange the cubes in a row so that no colour is
repeated along each of the four sides.

As its name suggests, Instant Insanity is very challenging to solve simply by trial and error.
There are a huge number of possible ways to arrange the cubes - the box claims 82,944.

The surprising and delightful thing about this puzzle is that you can solve it quickly 
using an elegant method based on simple concepts from the branch of mathematics known as graph theory.

One day in 1968, a university professor visited Arthur's high school and taught a math class about graph theory.
He finished the lecture by showing how to quickly solve Instant Insanity using graph theory.
Arthur was very impressed and looked for ways to use graph theory in his later academic and professional life.

Fast forward to the Internet era where we now have a wealth of excellent math animations on YouTube.
It occurred to Arthur that someone should create a compelling animation of the graph theory solution to Instant Insanity
in the hopes that this solution might also delight the current generation of young math enthusiasts
and perhaps inspire them to learn a little graph theory.

Fate intervened and reconnected Arthur with Will, a fellow high school student who had gone on to
become a professional animator.
This video is a collaboration between Will and Arthur.
It explains the puzzle and its graph theory solution without assuming any prior knowledge of the subject.
If you enjoy solving puzzles and have some exposure to high school mathematics then this video is for you.
