William (Bill) T. Tut was an eminent British graph theorist who,
after getting his PhD from Cambridge, came to Canada.
He started at the University of Toronto and later moved to the University of Waterloo.

Tut's PhD studies were interrupted by World War II when he joined the team of
legendary code-breakers, including Alan Turing, at Bletchley Park.
While Turing is famous for breaking the Enigma cipher, Tut is far less well-known for
cracking Lorenz, a.k.a. Fish, a.k.a. Tunny, which was much more challenging and kept top-secret for much longer.
Those familiar with his accomplishment say it was the greatest intellectual feat of World War II.

Tut was a member of the Trinity Four who, writing under the pseudonym of F. de Carteblanche,
published the 1947 Eureka paper containing the elegant graph theory solution to The Coloured Cubes Problem,
now known as Instant Insanity.

It is highly likely that Tut showed the solution to Honsberger, his puzzle-loving colleague at Waterloo.
Honsberger in turn showed it to the students at Northview, one of whom made this video.
Therefore, by watching this video, you have become part of an unbroken chain of communication 
that stretches right back to Tut!
If you have enjoyed learning Carteblanche's solution, then
be sure to retell it to the upcoming generation of math enthusiasts
and keep the chain growing.
