The professor who visited Northview and showed the students
how to solve Instant Insanity using
graph theory was Ross Honsberger from the University of Waterloo.

This was no coincidence.
Honsberger had been the Head of the Mathematics Department at Northview before
he returned to academia, got a PhD, and became of professor at Waterloo.

Honsberger loved mathematical puzzles and was a connoisseur of elegant solutions.
The Mathematical Association of America published a total of thirteen books 
authored by him on this topic.
Remarkably, none of them discusses Instant Insanity.
