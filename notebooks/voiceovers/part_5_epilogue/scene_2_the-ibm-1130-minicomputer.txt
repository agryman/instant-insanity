In the spring of 1966 the first computer installed in a secondary school
in Canada for instructional purposes only, an IBM model 1130, began
operations at Northview Heights Secondary School.

Arthur entered Northview in the fall of 1966 and so became one of the first
high school students in Canada to have hands-on access to a real computer.
He learned how to write FORTRAN programs and immediately coded up a brute-force
search to solve Instant Insanity.
The program took a long time to run but it eventually printed out the solution.
