Consider any combination.
We can generate another combination from it by rotating it by one quarter of a turn about the horizontal axis.
This operation sends the top faces to the front, the front to the bottom,
the bottom to the back, and the back to the top.

We can perform this rotation four times before ending up with the combination we started with.
Therefore every combination belongs to a family four essentially equivalent combinations.

Now suppose the combination was a solution.
Since the top faces contained all four colours before the rotation, so will the front faces after the rotation.
By the same reasoning, the bottom, back, and top faces will also contain all four colours after the rotation.
Therefore, this operation sends solutions to solutions.
Therefore, every solution belongs to a family of four essentially equivalent solutions.
