Our goal is to count the total number of possible combinations.
A combination consists of an ordering of the cubes together with an orientation for each cube.
Let's start by counting the total number of possible cube orderings.

We'll build up each ordering from left to right and keep track of our progress in a decision tree.
Each cube ordering requires us to make four choices, namely which cube goes in each position.
We have four choices for the first cube.
After we have made the first choice there are three cubes left so for each choice of the first cube we have three possibilities left for the second cube.
Similarly, for each ordering of the first two cubes we have two possibilities left for the third cube.
Finally, for each ordering of the first three cubes we only have one possibility left for the four cube.

Count all the cube orderings. There are 24 of them.
