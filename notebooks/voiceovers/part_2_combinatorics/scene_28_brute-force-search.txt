We now know that, in the absence of any shortcuts, we'd have to check 41,472 combinations in order to find a solution.
Given enough time and patience, we could systematically generate every possible essentially distinct combination
and check if it was a solution. 
Mathematicians call this approach a brute-force search.

How long would it take a human to perform a brute-force search?
Let's compute the total time.

As a rough estimate, suppose it takes our human 1 second to rotate a cube and 1 second to check
if the combination is a solution.
In some cases our human would have to rotate all four cubes to generate the next combination,
So allowing four seconds to rotate the cubes and 1 second to check the combination 
means it would take our human 5 seconds per combination.

There are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 24 hours in a day giving a total of 86,400 seconds per day.
At 5 seconds per combination, our human could try 17,280 combinations per day.

There are 41,472 essentially distinct combinations.
Therefore, our human would find the solution if they worked nonstop for 2.4 days and made no errors.
This is called the worst-case time since it assumes that we are unlucky and have to generate all the combinations
before we find the solution.

This puzzle is clearly challenging, which likely contributes to its enduring popularity.
