Suppose we have a combination. 
We can obtain another combination by rotating each cube by one half turn about its vertical axis.
We'll call this operation a half twist to distinguish it from a quarter turn.

A half twist does not change the cube ordering.
It also leaves the top and botton faces unchanged.
A half twist simply interchanges the front and back faces of the combination.
It also interchanges the left and right faces of each cube but they do not contribute to the solution so we can ignore them.

Suppose we started with a solution.
Since the top and bottom sides are unchanged, they each contain four different colours before and after the operation.
The back and front sides also each contain four distinct colours before the operation.
But the operation simply interchanges the back and front so they still each contain four different colours after the operation.
Therefore the half twist operation sends solutions to solutions.
