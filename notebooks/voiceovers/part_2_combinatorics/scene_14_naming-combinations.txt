We can use Carteblanche's cube and face names to describe any combination.

Each cube is labelled with a number from 1 to 4.
We can specify the orientation of a cube by saying which face is on top and which face is in front.
We'll refer to a cube together with an orientation as an oriented cube.

For example, suppose cube 3 is oriented with face y' on top face z in front.
We can label this oriented cube as 3y'z.

A combination consists of a row of four oriented cubes.
We can specify the combination by listing the labels of the oriented cubes from left to right.

For example the list (3y'z, 1xy, 4x'z, 2zx) specifies the combination
in which cube 3 is on the extreme left, followed by cubes 1, 4, and 2 from left right in that order.
Cube 3 is oriented with face y' on top and face z in front.
Cube 1 is oriented with face x on top and face y in front.
And so on for cubes 4 and 2.
