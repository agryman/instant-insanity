The 1947 Eureka paper, 
The Coloured Cubes Problem by F. de Carteblanche 
which gives the elegant graph theory solution to the problem states that 
if you pick a random arrangement of the cubes your chance of it being a solution is 1 in 41,472.
At that time, the puzzle was called the Tantalizer.
F. de Carteblanche was the pseudonym of a group of four Cambridge mathematics students 
which included the future eminent graph theorist Bill Tutte.
