How difficult is it to solve the puzzle?
One way to solve it is to try every possible combination of the cubes until we find one that works.
In computer science, this solution strategy is called a brute-force search.
In the absence of any further insight into how to solve the puzzle,
its difficulty is therefore directly proportional to the total number of combinations.

So how many combinations are there?
