Now let's precisely define what we mean by a combination of the cubes and a solution of the puzzle.

The 1947 Carteblanche paper describes the goal of the puzzle as follows:

The problem is to stack these cubes in a vertical pile (thus forming a square prism) 
in such a way that each of the four vertical faces of this pile contains all four colours.

The Winning Moves puzzle box asks:

Can you arrange the cubes in a row or stack so that all four colors appear on each side?

Clearly, it doesn't matter if we arrange the cubes in a vertical stack or a horizontal row because we can
easily turn one into the other.
In this video, we'll work with the cubes in a horizonal row.

We'll use the following terminology.

A combination is any arrangement of the four cubes in a row.
The cubes can be in any order and each cube can have any orientation.

A solution is any combination in which the top, front, bottom, and back rows of four faces each contain
all four colours.
