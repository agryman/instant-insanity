Carteblanche makes the following claim:

The chance of obtaining the solution by a random arrangement of the cubes is only 1 in 41,472.

The chance of an event is its relative frequency which is also known as its probability.
The probability of an event is some number between 0 and 1 where 0 means the event will never occur
and 1 means the event will always occur.
Probabilities greater than 0 and less than 1 quantify the degree to which the event may or may not occur.

To compute the probability of an event in which all possible outcomes are equally likely,
we need to divide the number of outcomes that satisfy the conditions for the event
by the total number of possible outcomes.

For example, the probability that a flip of a fair coin will come up heads is one half
because there are two possible outcomes, namely heads or tails, and only one of them is the event
we are looking for, namely heads.

Therefore, to compute the probability that a random combination is a solution,
we need to compute the number of solutions and the number of combinations.

Let N be the total number of possible cube combinations and let S be the total number of solutions.
Let P be the probability that a randomly chosen combination is a solution.
The probability P is therefore the number of solutions S divided by the number of combinations N.

Let's compute N and S and see what we get for P.
