How many ways can a single cube be oriented?

We can specify an orientation by saying which face is on top and which face is in front.
Let's count the number of orientations.

We'll use another basic theorem of combinatorics. 
If we have two sets of things, say A containing n things and B containing m things
then the number of ways we can pair things from A with things from B is n times m.

Here are we are pairing top faces with front faces.

A cube has 6 faces. Therefore, there are 6 ways to pick the top face.
