Combinatorics is the branch of mathematics that tells us how to count things.

One of the most important cases in combinatorics is how to count the number of ways that you can arrange a set of distinct objects in some order.
An arrangement of a set of distinct objects in some order is called a permuation of that set.

Combinatorics tells us that there are n factorial permutations of a set of n distinct objects.
To see this, observe that there are n ways to pick the first object, 
then for each choice of the first object there are n minus 1 ways to pick the second, and so on.

This is exactly how we counted the number of cube orderings.
There are four cubes and so combinatorics tells us there are four factorial ordering.
But four factorial equals twenty-four which is the result we obtained by enumerating all the orderings.
