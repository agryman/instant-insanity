Let H denote the notion of equivalence generated by the half twist operation. 
The cube orientation produced by a half twist is always different from any cube orientation 
that can be produced by applying some sequence of quarter turns to the starting orientation.

We can apply a half twist twice before returning to the starting orientation
so the orbit generated by H has size 2.
Therefore, we need to further divide the number of combinations by 2 to get 
the number of essentially distinct combinations when we regard combinations that differ by a half twist to
be essentially equivalent.

When we apply the H and Q operations, we get an orbit of size 2 times 4 = 8.
Applying the O operations to the QH orbits, we get an OQH orbit of size 8 times 24 = 192.
Therefore every combination belongs to a family of 192 essentially equivalent combinations.
So every solution belongs to family of 192 essentially equivalent solutions.

Let's compute the number of OQH orbits.
Divide the number of OQ orbits, namely 82,944, by the size of an H orbit, namely 2, to give the result 41,472.

Eureka! Carteblanche was right.
We now understand where the number 41,472 comes from. 
It is the number of essentially distinct combinations if we consider combinations that are related 
by any combination of O, Q, and H symmetry operations to be essentially equivalent.
Furthermore, as we will soon prove, there is exactly one essentially distinct combination that is a solution.

In summary, there are around 8 million combinations but these are divided into orbits of symmetry operations 
each consisting of 192 mutually equivalent combinations.
The total number of essentially distinct combinations is 41,472 and this is the true meassure of the difficulty 
of finding a solution by simply checking all combinations.
However, we can find the solution much more easily by using the elegant graph theory approach discovered by Carteblanche.
