There are several variations on the basic concept of a graph.
Here are some of the terms mathematicians use to describe them.

An edge that connects a node to itself is called a loop.
Edges that connect the same nodes are called parallel edges.

A graph that does not contain any loops or parallel edges is called a simple graph.
Our first example of a graph has no loops or parallel edges and is therefore a simple graph.
