A river containing two large islands ran through the city of Konigsberg.
Seven bridges crossed the river,
connecting the islands to its banks.
The people of Konigsberg amused themselves by trying to find
a walking path that crossed each of the bridges exactly once.
They were allowed to start and end the path anywhere, possibly on different landmasses.
We'll refer to the sought-after path as a tour.
Sadly, despite their efforts, no one could find a tour.
