If you feel that Rock-Paper-Scissors so simple that drawing its game graph is overkill,
then consider the more complex game of Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock.
See Wikipedia for its rules.
Now the game graph has five nodes and ten directed edges where, for simplicity, we have omitted
the edge labels.
The rules of this game can be read off at a glance from the graph.
