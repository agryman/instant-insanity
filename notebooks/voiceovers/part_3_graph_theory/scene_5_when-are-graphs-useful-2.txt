Recall that in a diagram of a graph, the precise positions of the nodes and edges are not important.
The only thing that counts is which nodes are connected by which edges.
Transport for London has used this flexibility to simplify life for travellers.
They published an iconic functional map of the Tube system
in which lines are oriented at multiples of forty-five degrees
and distances between stations are not drawn to scale.
The result is a map that is much easier to understand and use.

Discarding geographic accuracy to achieve a clearer layout
is an excellent example of how abstraction can be helpful.
This process of abstraction is again present in the use of
graph theory to solve Instant Insanity.
