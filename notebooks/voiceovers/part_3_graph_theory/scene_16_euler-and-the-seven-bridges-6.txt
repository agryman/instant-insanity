Here’s how Euler approached the problem.

He noticed that whenever you enter a landmass by one bridge, 
you must also leave it by another—except possibly at the start and end of your walk, 
which don’t have to be the same place.

That means the bridges connected to each landmass should come in enter-exit pairs. 
So, to walk each bridge exactly once, each landmass must have an even number of bridges 
connected to it—except maybe the start and end, which could each have an odd number.

In graph theory terms, this means:
If a tour exists then at most two nodes in the graph can have an odd degree.

But in the case of Konigsberg, 
all four landmasses (nodes) have odd degrees — three of them have degree 3, 
and one has degree 5.

That’s more than two odd-degree nodes, so the required tour can’t exist.

Problem solved!
