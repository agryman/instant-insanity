Here's a diagram of a small graph.
It consists of five points connected by four lines.

Not only do mathematicians sometimes give different meanings to the same term,
such as graph,
they also sometimes define different terms to mean the same thing.
This is very much the case in graph theory.
A graph may be called a network.
A point may be called a dot, vertex, or node.
A line may be called a link, edge, or arc.
Here, we’ll use the terms graph, node, and edge since they’ve become fairly standard.

Drawing a diagram of a graph helps us understand its structure,
but the exact placement of nodes and the way edges are drawn doesn’t matter.
All that matters is which nodes are connected by which edges.
The example shows just one of the many ways of drawing the graph as a diagram.
