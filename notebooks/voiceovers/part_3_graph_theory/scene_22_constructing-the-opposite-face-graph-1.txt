Let's compare the payoff matrix for Rock-Paper-Scissors to the face colour table for Instant Insanity.
Both tabulate all the relevant information about the game or puzzle at hand.
However, a table isn't necessarily the most effective to present this kind of information.
Tables are great for summarizing quantitative data but here we are trying to understand relationships.
In situations like this, we may be able to gain deeper insight by visualizing the key relationships in a graph.

For Rock-Paper-Scissors we needed to understand when one choice beats another.
We were able to clearly exhibit this relation as a directed, labelled graph.
Can we do something similar for Instant Insanity?

The answer is Yes.
Carteblanche found an excellent way to do represent the essence of Instant Insanity as a labelled multigraph.
We'll construct that next.
