Recall that focusing on the opposite-face pairs leads us to a two-stage search strategy
in which we first solve the top-bottom faces and then solve the front-back faces without ruining the top-bottom solution.

Carteblanche realized that you could succinctly represent the opposite-face colour information
using a small labelled multigraph which we'll call the opposite-face graph.
It has four nodes, one for each face colour, and twelve edges, three for each cube.

Here's how to construct the opposite-face graph.
Start by placing four nodes at the corners of a square and labelling each node with one of the four colours.
At this point the opposite-face graph has four nodes and no edges.

Next, do the following for each cube.

Imagine detaching the faces of the cube from each other 
and moving them away from the centre of the cube.
Next, connect pairs of opposite faces with an edge and 
label each of the three edges with the cube number and face name.
For example, the edge labels for cube 1 are 1x, 1y, and 1z.
Shrink the faces down to the size of the colour nodes of the graph.
Move the x edge together with its face nodes onto the corresponding colour nodes of graph.
Repeat this process for the y and z edges.
Now the graph has 3 new labelled edges.

After doing this for each cube the graph has 12 edges.

This completes the construction of the graph.
