There are two main reasons why representing a puzzle, game, or problem as a graph 
might be useful.
First, visualizing a problem as a graph may let us apply our powers of visual reasoning to its solution.
Second, thinking of a problem as a graph may lead us to omit some of its inessential features, 
possibly reducing it to a simpler and easier-to-solve problem.

For example, suppose you are on vacation in London, England and 
want to travel around the city using the Underground, commonly known as the Tube.
You could use the this geographically-accurate map showing Central London Connections.
This type of map has the advantage that you can accurately judge distances, but
it is somewhat challenging to use it for planning your route
because of the way the Tube lines curve and cross each other.
In a sense, this geographically-accurate map contains too much information.
All you are really interested in is how the Tube stations are connected.
