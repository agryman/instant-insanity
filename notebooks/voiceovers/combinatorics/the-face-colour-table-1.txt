Let's start the process of counting the number of combinations by first assigning names to
the cubes and their faces.
Fortunately, Carteblanche defined a nice naming scheme so we'll use that.
Carteblanche describes his scheme as follows:

In order to make the discussion clearer we shall give names to
the faces of the cubes in this way: the front, or nearest face will
be named the x face; and opposite face, or back, will be named
the x’ face. On the right will be the y face, and on the left the
y’ face. The top will be the z face and the bottom the z’ face.

The letters correspond to the usual x-y-z axes of three-dimensional space oriented using the so-called right-hand rule.
If you grab the z-axis with your right hand pointing your thumb in the positive z direction then
your fingers point in the direction of a rotation that sends the x-axis towards the y-axis.

Carteblanche summarized the face colours in a table.
Let's call this a face-colour table.
Here the face colours are G for green, R for red, O for orange, and W for white
which were the colours used in the 1947 version of the puzzle known as the Tantalizer.
