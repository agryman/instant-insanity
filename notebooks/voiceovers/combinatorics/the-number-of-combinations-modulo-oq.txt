A quarter turn about the horizontal axis does not change the cube ordering.
Therefore this additional symmetry operation increases the size of our families of 
essentially equivalent combinations by a factor of four and 
so reduces the number of combinations we need to search by the same factor.

Let Q denote the notion of equivalence generated by these quarter-turn symmetry operations. 
Clearly, these operations do not change the order of the cubes
and so they send one O orbit to another. 
In fact, the Q operations groups the set the O orbits into sets of four related orbits.
We refer to these combined orbits as OQ orbits.
Each OQ orbit contains 4 times 24 = 96 combinations.

Let's compute the number of OQ orbits.
Take the number of combinations modulo O, namely 331,776, and divide it by the size of the Q orbit, 
namely 4, to get 82,944 as the number of combinations module OQ.

Progress! Now we understand where the number 82,944 comes from.
It is the number of essentially distinct combinations where we consider combinations 
related by O and Q operations to be essentially equivalent.

But what about 41,472?
The explanation is similar to the above.
We have yet another symmetry operation.

This additional symmetry operation is similar to the quarter turns but is a little less obvious.
