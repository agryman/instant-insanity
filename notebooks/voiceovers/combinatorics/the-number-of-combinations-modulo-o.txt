As previously discussed, we are going to regard all combinations 
that differ only in cube ordering as being essentially equivalent.
When mathematicians say that two objects are equivalent with regard to some property, 
they say that the objects are equivalent modulo that property, or more briefly, mod that property.

Let O denote the notion of equivalence of combinations when we ignore the order of the cubes.
Every combination belongs to a family of 24 combinations that are equalivent modulo O.

Let's calculate the number of combinations modulo O.
Since the swap operations divide the set of all combinations into orbits of size 24,
the number of combinations modulo O is the number of combinations divided by 24.

Now we get that there are 331,776 essentially distinct combinations 
which is much smaller than 7,962,624 but still much bigger than 82,944.
Why are we still getting more than 82,944?
The reason is that we should regard more combinations as being essentially equivalent.
We'll do this next.
