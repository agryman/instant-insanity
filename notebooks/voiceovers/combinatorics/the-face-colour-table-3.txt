For example, face 3y' is the name of the left face of cube 3.
It's colour is given in the cell at row y' and column 3 of the face colour table.
We can look up the colour of this face in the table and see that it is B which stands for blue.

There is nothing special about this particular way of labelling the faces other than the fact 
that the front and top faces contain each colour once.
However, the back and bottom faces contain some repeated colours so we still have to search for a solution.
