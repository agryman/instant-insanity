A combination is fully specified by giving the ordering of the four cubes and the orientation of each of cube.
There are 24 orderings of the cubes.
Each of the four cubes has 24 orientations.
Apply the basic combination rule again to get the total number of combinations as follows.
Multiply the number of cube orderings and the number of cube orientations multiplied by itself four times
which is the same as raising the number of cube orientations to the power 4.

We get a whopping total of 7,962,624 combinations which is much bigger than 
the number 82,944 which is claimed on the box and in the YouTube videos.

Why the difference?

The answer to this question is that, 
although random draws do generate 7,962,624 distinct cube combinations,
we should not consider them all to be essentially distinct.
It turns out that we can easily transform any combination into many other essentially equivalent
ones by applying what are known as symmetry operations.
These symmetries transform solutions to solutions.

The branch of mathematics that studies symmetry operations is called group theory.
Next we'll apply some group theory to compute the number of essentially distinct combinations.
