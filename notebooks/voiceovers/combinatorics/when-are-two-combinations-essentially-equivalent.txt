We can specify a combination by giving a cube ordering and an orientation for each cube.
An orientation is given by specifying the top and front faces.
Consider the combination given by the four-tuple (one z x', two z x', three z y', four z x').
This combination is in fact a solution.

Now create a new combination by swapping the positions of any two cubes, say one and two, 
without changing their orientations.
The new combination is given by the four-tuple (two z x', one z x', three z y', four z x').
Since each side of the row contained four different colours before the swap, 
it will still contain four different colours after the swap.
Therefore the new combination is also a solution.

In general, changing the order of the cubes while perserving the orientation of each cube 
sends combinations to combinations and solutions to solutions.
We can achieve any cube ordering by swapping pairs of cubes.
As we computed above, there are twenty-four possible orderings of four cubes.
Therefore, we can use swaps to split up the set of all combinations into families 
that each consist of twenty-four related combinations.
This means that given any solution, it belongs to a family of twenty-four solutions 
that differ from each other only in the cube ordering.

It is natural to regard solutions that differ only in the cube ordering as being essentially equivalent 
since we can transform one into the other by a sequence of swaps.
We can therefore use this notion of equivalence to cut down the size of our search space by a factor of twenty-four.
Rather than examining all combinations for solutions, we can safely confine our attention to one fixed cube ordering, 
say the natural ordering one, two, three, four.
