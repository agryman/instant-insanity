Let's apply this naming scheme to the Instant Insanity puzzle currently sold by Winning Moves.
Now the colours are G for green, R for red, B for blue, and W for white.

First pick some arbitrary order for the cubes and name them 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Of course, there is nothing special about this particular numbering.

Next pick some arbitrary orientation for each cube and name the front, right, and top faces x, y, and z.
Name their opposite faces x', y', and z'.

Having numbered the cubes and labelled their faces, we can record the face colours in the table.
