Let's apply this naming scheme to the Instant Insanity puzzle currently sold by Winning Moves.

First arrange the four cubes in some order name them 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Any order will do.

Next orient each cube by chosing one of its six faces to be the top
and one of the four adjacent faces to be the front.
Any orientation will do.
Name the front, right, and top faces as x, y, and z.
Name their opposite faces as x', y', and z'.

Now all the cubes and faces have been named so we can fill in the table with their colours.
Use G for green, R for red, B for blue, and W for white.
