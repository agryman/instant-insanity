Here is a table that summarizes the face colours for Instant Insanity
using the labelling scheme given in Carteblanche's paper.

We have numbered the cubes from 1 to 4.
Of course, there is nothing special about this particular numbering.
There are 4 factorial, namely 24, ways to number the cubes and we have arbitrarily picked one of them.

We have also labelled each face as 
x for front,
x prime for back,
y for right,
y prime for left,
z for top, and
z prime for back.

A face labelled with primed letter is opposite the face labelled with that unprimed letter.

The letters correspond to the usual x-y-z axes of three-dimensional space oriented using the so-called right-hand rule.
If you grab the z-axis with your right hand pointing your thumb in the position z direction then
your finger point in the direction of a rotation that sends the x-axis towards the y-axis.

There are also 24 ways to label the faces of a cube.
This comes about by first labelling any one of the six faces of the cube as x and 
then labelling any its four adjacent faces as y.
These two labels completely determine the remaining four labels.

There is nothing special about this particular way of labelling the faces other than the fact 
that the front and top faces are already solved.
However, the back and bottom are not so we still have to search for a solution.

This table is similar to the payoff matrix for Rock-Paper-Scissors
in the sense that they both contain all relevant information, 
but not necessarily in the most useful way.
In situations like this we may be able to gain insight by visualizing the key relationships in a graph.
So what are the key relationships for Instant Insanity?
