Before diving into how to represent Instant Insanity as a graph,
let's consider the well-known two-player game of Rock–Paper–Scissors.
We'll call our players Alice and Bob.
Recall that each player secretly chooses
one of the three objects: rock, paper, or scissors.
Then, at the same time, they reveal a hand sign that represents their choice.
The rules are simple: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
The loser pays the winner one dollar. If it’s a tie, no money changes hands.

We can record all of these rules in a payoff matrix,
which shows how much each player wins or loses depending on what they choose.
The rows represent Alice's choice, and the columns represent Bob's.
Each matrix cell contains a pair of numbers that give the payoff to Alice
and Bob respectively.

The payoff matrix gives a complete definition of the game,
but it takes some mental effort to understand.
We can represent the essence of the game more clearly in a directed, labelled graph as follows.
The game graph has three nodes, each representing a possible choice, and three directed edges
each representing the "beats" relation.
A directed edge from node X to node Y means that choice X beats choice Y.

If you feel that Rock-Paper-Scissors so simple that drawing its game graph is overkill,
consider the more complex game of Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock.
See Wikipedia for its rules.
Now the game graph has five nodes and ten directed edges where, for simplicity, we have omitted
the edge labels.
The rules of this game can be read off at a glance from the graph.
