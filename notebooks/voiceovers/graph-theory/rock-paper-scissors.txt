Before diving into how to represent Instant Insanity as a graph,
let's consider the well-known two-player game of Rock–Paper–Scissors.
We'll call our players Alice and Bob.
Recall that each player secretly picks one of the three objects: rock, paper, or scissors. 
Then, they reveal their choices at the same time.
The rules are simple: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
The loser pays the winner one dollar. If it’s a tie, no money changes hands.

We can capture all of these rules in a payoff matrix, 
which shows how much each player wins or loses depending on what they choose.
The rows represents Alice's choice and the columns represent Bob's.

The payoff matrix gives a complete definition of the game but it takes some
mental effort to understand.
We can represent the essence of the game in a directed, labelled graph as follows.
The game graph has three nodes, each labelled by a possible choice, and three directed edges
each labelled by the beats relation.
A directed edge from node X to node Y means that choice X beats choice Y.

If you feel that Rock-Paper-Scissors so simple that drawing its game graph is overkill,
consider the more complex game of Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock.
See Wikipedia for its rules.
Now the game graph has five labelled nodes and ten directed edges where, for simplicity, we have omitted 
the edge labels.
The rules of this game can be read off at a glance from the graph.
