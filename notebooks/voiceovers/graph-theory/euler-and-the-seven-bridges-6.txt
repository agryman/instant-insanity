Here is how Euler reasoned.
He realized that as you take any path, you both enter and exit each landmass,
except possibly for the start and end of the path which are allowed to be different.
If you cross each bridge exactly once, then the number of bridges that meet each landmass
must therefore be an even number, except possibly for the start and end if they are on different landmases.

We can translate this observation into the language of graph theory as follows.
If a tour exists, then at most two nodes of the bridge graph can have odd degrees.

But all four of the nodes in the Konigsberg bridge graph have odd degrees, namely
three nodes have degree three and one node has degree five.
So the Konisberg bridge graph has more than two nodes of odd degree which 
implies that no tour exists.

Problem solved!
