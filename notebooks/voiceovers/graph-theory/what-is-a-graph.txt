In high school, we learn to draw graphs of functions on the familiar x-y coordinate plane.
But in graph theory, the word graph has a different meaning.
A graph is simply a collection of points, some of which are connected by lines.

Mathematicians may use different words for these objects, depending on the context.
A point may be called a dot, vertex, or node.
A line may be called a link, edge, or arc.
Here, we’ll use the terms node and edge, since they’re commonly used in software packages.

The diagram shows an example of a simple graph that contains five nodes connected by four edges.
Drawing a diagram helps us understand the structure of a graph,
but the exact placement of nodes and the way edges are drawn doesn’t matter.
All that matters is which nodes are connected by which edges.
