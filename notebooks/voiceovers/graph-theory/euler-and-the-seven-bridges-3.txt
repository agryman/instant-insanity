Euler managed to prove that no tour existed!
He demonstrated this by abstracting the layout of Konisberg into a graph 
in which the nodes represented its four landmasses and the edges
represented the seven bridges connecting them.

Start by simplifying the geographic map into
a diagram that shows the four landmasses,
the river separating them,
and the seven bridges connecting them.
