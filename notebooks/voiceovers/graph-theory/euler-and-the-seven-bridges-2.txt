A river ran through the city of Konigsberg and seven bridges crossed it,
interconnecting its two banks and two large islands.
The people of Konigsberg amused themselves by trying to find
a walking path that crossed each of the seven bridges exactly once.
They were allowed to start and end the path anywhere, possibly on different landmasses.
We'll refer to the sought-after walking path as a tour.
Sadly, despite their efforts, no one could find a tour.
