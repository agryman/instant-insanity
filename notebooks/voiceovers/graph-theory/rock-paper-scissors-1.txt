Before diving into how to represent Instant Insanity as a graph,
let's consider the well-known two-player game of Rock–Paper–Scissors.
We'll call our players Alice and Bob.
Recall that each player secretly chooses
one of the three objects: rock, paper, or scissors.
Then, at the same time, they reveal a hand sign that represents their choice.
The rules are simple: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
The loser pays the winner one dollar. If it’s a tie, no money changes hands.

We can record all of these rules in a payoff matrix,
which shows how much each player wins or loses depending on what they choose.
The rows represent Alice's choice, and the columns represent Bob's.
Each matrix cell contains a pair of numbers that give the payoff to Alice
and Bob respectively.
