They are several variations on the basic concept of a graph.
Here are some of the terms mathematicians use to describe them.

An edge that connects a node to itself is called a loop.
Edges that connect the same nodes are called parallel edges.

A graph that does not contain any loops or parallel edges is called a simple graph.
Our first example of a graph has no loops or parallel edges and is therefore a simple graph.

Graphs often arise in situations where nodes and edges have properties.
A graph in which each node and edge is labelled with some data is called a labelled graph.
The label might simply be an identifier, or it might contain numerical data.

Let's label the nodes and edges of our example graph.
Label the nodes as A through E.
Label the edges as 1 through 4.
Now we have a labelled graph.

A graph that contains loops or parallel edges is called a multigraph.
Let's add loop 5 at node B and a parallel edge 6 connecting nodes D and E.
Now we have a labelled multigraph.

A graph in which each edge is assigned a direction is called a directed graph.
Let's give each edge in our example graph a direction.
Now we have a directed, labelled multigraph.

Directed, labelled multigraphs will be used in the solution of Instant Insanity.

Finally, the degree of a node is the number of edges that meet it
where we count a loop as two edges.
For example, node B has degree 4 and all the other nodes have degree 2.
If the graph is directed then the in-degree of a node is the number of
edges that enter it and its out-degree is the number of edges that
leave it. In this case, the degree of the node is called its
total degree and is equal to the sum of its in-degree and out-degree.
For example, node D has out-degree 2 and in-degree 0.
The following table shows the degrees of the nodes in our example
directed graph.
