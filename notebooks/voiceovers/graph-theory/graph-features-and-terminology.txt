They are several variations on the basic concept of a graph.
Here are some of the terms mathematicians use to describe them.

An edge that connects a node to itself is called a loop.
Edges that connect the same nodes are called parallel edges.

A graph that does not contain any loops or parallel edges is called a simple graph.
Our first example of a graph has not loops or parallel edges and is therefore a simple graph.

Graphs often arise in situations where nodes and edges have properties.
A graph in which each node and edge is labelled with some data is called a labelled graph.

Let's label the nodes and edges of our example graph.
Label the nodes as A through E.
Label the edges as 1 through 4.
Now we have a labelled graph.

A graph that contains loops or parallel edges is called a multigraph.
Let's add a parallel edge from A to B and a loop at C.
Now we have a labelled multigraph.

A graph in which each edge is assigned a direction is called a directed graph.
Finally, let's assign a direction to each edge in our example graph.
Now we have a directed, labelled multigraph.

Directed, labelled multigraphs will be used in the solution of Instant Insanity.
