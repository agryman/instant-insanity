The payoff matrix gives a complete definition of the game,
but it takes some mental effort to understand.
Here is where the power of graph theory comes in.

The graphs that represent the Tube lines of London and the bridges of Konisberg are both abstractions of
geographic information.
The diagram of their graphs looks like a nongeographic version of their maps.

However, we can also use a graph to represent nongeographic relationships 
that might exist between objects in some collection.
In mathematics such a set of relationships is called a binary relation or, simply, a relation.

We can visualize a relation as a graph by creating a node for each object and an edge for each relationship.
If the relation has a direction then so do the edges.

For the London Tube the objects are stations and the relation is that a Tube line connects them.

For Konisberg the objects are landmasses and the relation is that a bridge connects them.

For Rock-Paper-Scissors the objects are choices and the directed relation is that one choice beats the other.
Its game graph has three nodes, each representing a possible choice, and three directed edges
each representing a case where one choice beats another.
