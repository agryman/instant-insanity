We can record the way that pairs of opposite faces are coloured in a labelled multigraph as follows.
Create four nodes, one for each colour and label each node with the colour it represents.
Draw an edge between nodes whenever a cube has a pair of opposite faces with those colours.
Each cube has three pairs of opposite faces, namely top-bottom, front-back, and left-right.
There are four cubes, so the multigraph contains twelve edges in total.
Label each edge with its cube number and axis name.
For example, 3z is the label for the top-bottom pair of faces of cube 3.
