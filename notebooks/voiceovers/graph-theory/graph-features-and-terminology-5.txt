One of the most important properties of a node is its degree.
The degree of a node is the number of edges that meet it
where we count a loop as meeting its node twice.
For example, node B has degree 4 and all the other nodes have degree 2.

If the graph is directed, then the in-degree of a node is the number of
edges that enter it and its out-degree is the number of edges that
leave it. In this case, the degree of the node is called its
total degree and is equal to the sum of its in-degree and out-degree.

For example, node D has out-degree 2 and in-degree 0.
The table shows the degrees of the nodes in our example
directed graph.
