There are two main reasons why representing a puzzle, game, or problem as a graph 
might be useful.
First, visualizing a problem as a graph may let us apply our powers of visual reasoning to its solution.
Second, thinking of a problem as a graph may lead us to omit some of its inessential features, 
possibly reducing it to a simpler and easier-to-solve problem.

For example, suppose you are on vacation in London, England and 
want to travel around the city using the Underground, commonly known as the Tube.
You could use the following geographically accurate map showing Central London Connections.
This type of map has the advantage that you can accurately judge distances but 
it is somewhat difficult to plan your route
because of the way the Tube lines curve and cross.
In a sense, this type of map contains too much information.
All you are really interested in is how the Tube stations are connected.

Recall that in a graph, the precise positions of the nodes and edges are not important.
The only thing that counts is which nodes are connected by which which edges.
Transport for London has used this fact to make life simpler for travellers
by publishing an iconic functional map of the Tube system
in which all lines are oriented at multiples of forty-five degrees 
and distances are not drawn to scale.
The result is a map that is much easier to understand and use.

Discarding geographic accuracy in order to achieve a clearer layout
is an excellent example of the potential benefit of abstraction.
This process of abstraction plays a key role in the use of 
graph theory to solve Instant Insanity.
