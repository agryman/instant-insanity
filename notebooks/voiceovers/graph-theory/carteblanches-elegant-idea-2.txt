Now consider an arrangement of the four cubes in which the top-bottom faces are solved, 
but the front-back faces might not be.
You can freely turn each cube about its vertical axis to try different front-back arrangements without ruining the top-bottom solution.

This observation suggests that you should try to solve the puzzle in two stages.
First, you try to solve the top-bottom faces by rotating the cubes without any restrictions.
Then, you try to solve the front-back faces but retricting yourself to quarter turns about the vertical axis so that
you don't ruin the top-bottom solution.

It may be that there are no front-back solutions that work with a given top-bottom solution.
In this case you must look for another top-bottom solution and then try to solve the front-back again.
This process is called back-tracking.

It turns out that breaking down the solution strategy into these two stages greatly speeds up the search for a solution.
