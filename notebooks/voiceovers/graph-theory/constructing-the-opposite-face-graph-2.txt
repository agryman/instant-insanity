The face colour table for Instant Insanity is similar to the payoff matrix for Rock-Paper-Scissors
in the sense that they both completely describe a puzzle or game but not necessarily in the most useful way.
In situations like this we may be able to gain insight by visualizing the key relationships in a graph.

Recall the importance of the opposite-face pairs for finding a solution.
Carteblanche realized that you could succinctly represent the opposite-face colour information
using a fairly small labelled multigraph which we'll call the opposite-face graph.
It had four nodes, one for each face colour, and twelve edges, three for each cube.

Here's how to construct the opposite-face graph.
Initialize the opposite-face graph by drawing four nodes in a square and give each node one of the four colours.
At this point the opposite-face graph has four nodes and no edges.

Start with cube 1.
Imagine its faces detaching from each other and moving away from the centre of the cube.
Connect pairs of opposite faces with an edge and label each of the three edges as 1x, 1y, and 1z.
Shrink the faces to be the size of the colour nodes in the opposite-face graph.
Move the 1x edge together with its face nodes onto the corresponding nodes of the opposite-face graph.
Repeat this process for edges 1y and 1z.
Now the opposite-face graph has 3 edges.

Repeat this process for cubes 2, 3, and 4.
Now the opposite-face graph has 12 edges.

This completes the construction of the opposite-face graph.
