Carteblanche was an expert in graph theory as early as 1940.
Writing under their real names, the Trinity Four published a graph-theoretic solution
to the Dissection of Rectangles into Squares, a problem which was itself inspired by
puzzle number 40, Lady Isabel's Casket in Henry Ernest Dudeney's 1908 book The Canterbury Puzzles.

Carteblanche had the elegant idea that the way to crack Instant Insanity was to
focus on opposite-face pairs.
Observe that when you fix the top face of a cube,
then you also fix its bottom face,
but you can still rotate the cube by quarter turns about its vertical axis
without disrupting the top and bottom faces.

This observation lets you solve the puzzle in two stages.
First, you solve the top-bottom faces by rotating the cubes without any restrictions.
Then, you solve the front-back faces retricting yourself to only quarter turns about the vertical axis so that
you don't spoil the top-bottom solution.
Breaking down the problem into these two stages greatly reduced the search space.

Carteblanche also realized that you could succinctly represent the opposite-face information
using a fairly small labelled multigraph which we'll call the opposite-face graph.
It had four nodes, one for edge colour, and twelve edges, three for each cube.
Solving the top-bottom and front-back faces corresponded to finding two special subsets of the
opposite-face graph.
