Before delving further into graph theory, let's take a brief excursion into its history.
It turns out that solving a recreational puzzle inspired the creation of graph theory.
The famous mathematician Leonhard Euler laid the foundations for graph theory in 1736
when he settled the popular Seven Bridges of Konigsberg problem.
Wikipedia explains this problem in great detail.
Here's a brief summary.

A river ran through the city of Konigsberg and seven bridges crossed it, interconnecting its two banks and two large islands.
The people of Konigsberg amused themselves by trying to find a walking path that crossed each of the seven bridges exactly once.
They were allowed to start and end the tour anywhere, possibly on different land masses.
We'll refer to the sought-after walking path as a tour.
Sadly, despite their efforts no one could find a tour.
Euler managed to prove that no tour existed!
He demonstrated this by abstracting the layout of Konisberg into a graph 
in which the nodes represented its four land masses and the edges
represented the seven bridges connecting them.

Here is how he reasoned.
Euler realized that as you take any path you must both enter and exit each land mass,
except possibly for the start and end of the path which are allowed to be different.
If you use each bridge exactly once, then the number of bridges that meet each land mass,
except possibly for the start and end, must therefore be an even number.
In the language of graph theory this means that if a tour exists then 
at most two nodes of the bridge graph can have odd degrees.
But the Konigsberg bridge graph has three nodes of degree three and one node of degree five,
all of which are odd numbers.
Therefore no tour of the Konigsberg bridges exists.
Problem solved!
