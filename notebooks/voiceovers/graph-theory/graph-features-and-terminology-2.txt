Graphs often arise in situations where nodes and edges have properties.
A graph in which each node and edge is labelled with some data is called a labelled graph.
The label might simply be an identifier, or it might contain numerical data.

Let's label the nodes and edges of our example graph.
Label the nodes as A through E.
Label the edges as 1 through 4.
Now we have a labelled graph.
