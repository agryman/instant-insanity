Carteblanche had the elegant idea that the key to cracking Instant Insanity was to
focus on the opposite-face pairs of each cube.

Observe that when you choose which face of a cube to be the top
then that determines which face is the bottom.

However you can still rotate the cube by quarter turns about its vertical axis
without changing the top and bottom faces.
This lets you choose which of the remainding four faces to be the front.
Of course, once you choose the front face then that determines the back face.

In general, once you have chosen the position of one face then you have
automatically chosen the position of its opposite face.
You still have the freedom to rotate the cube about the axis through the
chosen faces without changing their positions.
