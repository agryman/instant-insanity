Carteblanche realized that the key to cracking the puzzle was to
focus on the opposite-face pairs that make up each cube.

Observe that when you rotate some face of a cube into the top position
then that determines which face is in the bottom position.

However you can still rotate the cube by quarter turns about its vertical axis
without changing the top and bottom faces.
This limited freedom lets you choose which of the remaining four faces will occupy the front position.
Of course, once you choose the front face then that determines the back face.

In general, once you have positioned any one face then, as a side effect,
you have also positioned its opposite face.
You still have the freedom to rotate the cube about the axis through those
faces without changing their positions.
