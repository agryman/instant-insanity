    "In mathematics, a graph is a collection of points connected by lines.\n",
    "Each line connects a pair of distinct points and each pair of distinct points is connected by at most one line.\n",
    "The simple example shown here contains five points connected by four lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we have drawn a picture of the graph, the positions of the points\n",
    "and the paths taken by the lines are not essential features of the graph.\n",
    "Only the fact that certain pairs of points are connected is significant.\n",
    "We are therefore free to lay out the points and lines in any way that makes the graph easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "A point is sometimes called a vertex or a node.\n",
    "A line is sometimes called an edge or an arc.\n",
    "We'll use the terms node and edge here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Representing a puzzle, game, or mathematical problem as a graph may be helpful for two main reasons.\n",
    "First, visualizing the problem as a graph may let us usefully apply our powers of visual reasoning to its solution.\n",
    "Second, we may be able to omit inessential features of the problem from the graph and so reduce it to a simpler \n",
    "and easier-to-solve problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of omiting inessential features is a general problem-solving strategy\n",
