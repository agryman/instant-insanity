      "when he settled the popular Seven Bridges of Konigsberg problem.\n",
      "Wikipedia explains this problem in great detail.\n",
      "Here's a brief summary.\n",
      "\n",
      "A river ran through the city of Konigsberg and seven bridges crossed it, interconnecting its two banks and two large islands.\n",
      "The people of Konigsberg amused themselves by trying to find a walking path that crossed each of the seven bridges exactly once.\n",
      "They were allowed to start and end the tour anywhere, possibly on different land masses.\n",
      "We'll refer to the sought-after walking path as a tour.\n",
      "Sadly, despite their efforts no one could find a tour.\n",
      "Euler managed to prove that no tour existed!\n",
      "He demonstrated this by abstracting the layout of Konisberg into a graph \n",
      "in which the nodes represented its four land masses and the edges\n",
      "represented the seven bridges connecting them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is how he reasoned.\n",
      "The number of edges that meet a node is called its degree.\n",
      "The Konigsberg bridge graph has three nodes of degree three and one node of degree five.\n",
      "Note that these degrees, three and five, are odd numbers.\n",
      "Euler observed that if a tour exists, then each time you enter a land mass you must also leave it, \n",
      "except possibly for the case in which you start and end the tour on different land masses. \n",
      "Translating this observation into the language of graph theory gives the requirement that each node, \n",
      "except possibly the start and end of the tour, must have an even degree.\n",
      "Euler realized that this implies that if a tour exists then at most two nodes, \n",
      "namely the start and end, can have odd degrees.\n",
      "However, all four nodes of the Konisberg graph have odd degrees.\n",
