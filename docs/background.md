During the 1960's, Junior High School students in Ontario had to choose
between three streams: Arts & Science, Business & Commerce, 
and Science, Technology, & Trades. 
Being a science geek, I chose the latter, which meant I had to travel
outside my immediate school area to attend high school at 
[Northview Heights Secondary School](https://schoolweb.tdsb.on.ca/northviewheights). 

I entered Grade 10 at Northview in 1966.
This turned out to be a very lucky move because
Northview had the unusual distinction of having a computer. 
The computer was an 
[IBM 1130 minicomputer](https://www.tnmoc.org/ibm1130),
built using the same technology as the IBM 360 mainframe.

The computer was housed in a dedicated room that also had a card reader,
line printer, and several card punch machines. 
Computer programming was not an official part of the curriculum, but
one teacher, Mr. Wong, held classes after school for those interested.
He taught us Fortran IV, which was the language of choice at the time.

Around that time, Parker Brothers had published the Instant Insanity puzzle.
I don't remember if I ever solved it by hand, but I do remember writing
a Fortran program to solve it. Prior to running that program,
all the programs I had written executed almost instantly.
At that time, students were given full access to the computer.
You'd put your card deck in the reader, press the start button, watch
the cards fly through the reader, and then hear the line printer write out
the results.

My Instant Insanity program was different. It was a brute force search
through all the possible orientations of the four cubes.
After my cards were read, the line printer remained silent.
Instead, I saw lights flashing on the console and 
heard the almost musical sounds of disk drive arms moving. 
Some hackers had in fact figured out how to play recognizable tunes
using the sounds that the disk drive arms made.
But the line printer was silent.
Would my program ever find a solution?
After what seemed like an eternity, the line printer started up
and out came the first solution. Then a few more, but they were simply
rotations of the first one. Not a very optimal search.
I felt that I had conquered the puzzle.
In no way did I imagine that there might be an elegant way of solving it.

Aside from the computer, and some very encouraging math and physics teachers,
Northview also provided enrichment in the form of guest speakers.
I still remember a talk by 
[Prof. W.W. Sawyer](https://www.wwsawyer.org), 
a British mathematician on the faculty of 
the University of Toronto who introduced us to Group Theory and 
what I now recognize as Galois Theory. 

But the talk that had the greatest impact on me
was by 
[Prof. Ross Honsberger](https://uwaterloo.ca/combinatorics-and-optimization/professor-ross-honsberger), 
a Canadian mathematician 
on the faculty of the University of Waterloo. 
He introduced us to Graph Theory
and then showed us how to use it to solve the Instant Insanity puzzle.
I was extremely impressed by the ingenuity of his solution,
especially in comparison to my brute force Fortran search.
That lecture had a big influence on my academic and professional career.
The lesson I learned was that sometimes a difficult problem
can be solved by looking at it in a different way.
It also showed me the power of abstraction.
Not abstraction for its own sake, but abstraction in the sense of
eliminating irrelevant details and focusing on the essential structure
of the problem.

I enjoyed that lecture so much that I would like to share the experience
with as many people as possible, especially young people who need to decide
what to do with their lives. 
Creating a mathematical animation seems like a great way to 
explain the solution.
I hope it will inspire students to study mathematics and improve their
ability use abstraction as a tool for solving difficult problems.

I think it would be fitting to dedicate the animation to Prof. Honsberger,
who passed away in 2011. He was an inspiring teacher and a great Canadian.
