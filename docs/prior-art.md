## Prof. Ross Honsberger, 1969

I learned how to solve Instant Insanity using Graph Theory as a Grade 12 high school student at Northview Heights Secondary School in North York, Toronto around 1969 
when Prof. Ross Honsberger of the University of Waterloo visited us and gave a lecture. 
I don't remember anything else about the lecture.
It may have been an introduction Graph Theory or Combinatics.
My only clear memory was the ingeneous solution to the Instant Insanity puzzle.

I was very inspired by the lecture.
It had a big influence on my academic and professional life.
My motive for creating a mathematic animation of the solution is to inspire the next generation of high school students. 

I don't know who discoved the solution. 
I'll do a literature search.
