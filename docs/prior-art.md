## Prof. Ross Honsberger, 1969

I learned how to solve Instant Insanity using Graph Theory as a Grade 12 high school student at Northview Heights Secondary School in North York, Toronto around 1969 
when Prof. Ross Honsberger of the University of Waterloo visited us and gave a lecture. 
I don't remember anything else about the lecture.
It may have been an introduction to Graph Theory or Combinatorics.
My only clear memory was the ingenious solution to the Instant Insanity puzzle.
I don't know who discovered the solution. 
I'll do a literature search.

## YouTube

I found the following videos.

Imagine you have four cubes, whose faces are colored red, blue, yellow, and green. Can you stack these cubes so that each color appears exactly once on each of the four sides of the stack?

Now, the coloring on these cubes is very important. In other words:
weâ€™re only considering THESE four particular cubes.
So, for example, cube 1 has exactly three red faces, and one yellow, green, and blue face,
moreover, those colors appear on the particular faces as indicated.
Similarly, for the other cubes.

* very slick and professional video
* does define graph, vertex, edge, subgraph, directed graph
* does contain animation
* does use directed edges to give orientation of the subgraphs
* doesn't define 2-factors
* doesn't explain 82,044
* doesn't animate or show in any way the tree search for independent 2-factors

Instant Insanity is a puzzle that has been around for more than 50 years.  
This video discusses the solution to the puzzle and the motivation behind the solution.

* uses sequence of computer diagrams, like a PowerPoint
* not great explanation
* tries to motivate the graph theory but doesn't define graph concepts
* mentions abstraction
* creates the usual graph and then verbally describes the tree search
* doesn't mention 2-factors
* lots of hard-to-follow verbal description
* uses directed graph
* produces solution without showing the tree search
* awkward illustrations, bad use of perspective ("a little confusing" in his own words)
* talks about rotation but doesn't animate it

I present a solution to the instant insanity puzzle, also known as the four cubes problem.

Course material for MAS341: Graph Theory at the University of Sheffield.

* video of him at a blackboard
* does a tree search
* fails to mention 2-factors
* fails to assign orientations to the 2-factors
* no animation
* following his reasoning requires a lot of attention
* could be made more explicit using an animation of a tree search

4 cubes with 4 colours across their 6 faces, 82,944 possible ways of stacking them - how do we stack them to have all four colours on each side of the stack?
This is the problem of Instant Insanity, to which there are two distinct methods of solution. Robin Wilson, Gresham Professor of Geometry, here explains how to solve it using graph theory.

This is the 23rd part of 'A Millennium of Mathematical Puzzles'.
The full lecture is available (in 24 parts) here on YouTube, or it can be downloaded (like all of our lectures) in its complete form from the Gresham College website, in video, audio or text formats:
http://www.gresham.ac.uk

Gresham College has been giving free public lectures since 1597. This tradition continues today with all of our five or so public lectures a week being made available for free download from our website.

* video of him at overhead projector in public lecture
* shows graphs and produces subgraphs (2-factors)
* then lines up the cubes
* doesn't show the process of finding the 2-factors
* doesn't give the 2-factors an orientation
* doesn't explain the number $82,944 = 6 \times 24^3$ of combinations
* no animations, just hand drawn graphs

4 cubes with 4 colours across their 6 faces, 82,944 possible ways of stacking them - how do we stack them to have all four colours on each side of the stack?
This is the problem of Instant Insanity, to which there are two distinct methods of solution. Robin Wilson, Gresham Professor of Geometry, here explains how to solve it by associating the colours with different prime numbers.

### Beat the Sea Crates (Instant Insanity) Puzzle from CBS Survivor by SurvivorCrafts

This puzzle has been run 6 times on Survivor. 
The 4 most recent puzzles have been identical in pattern. 
Comment on the video and I'll send you the cube layouts, if desired. 
The key to beating this challenge is to find cubes that have the same color on opposite sides. 
I call them doubles in the video. This will allow you to solve two sides very quickly. 
The rest is trial and error working from the top down or down up.

* shows how to solve a simplified version of the puzzle
* not relevant
