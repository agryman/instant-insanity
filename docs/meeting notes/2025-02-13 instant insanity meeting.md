# 2025-02-13 Instant Insanity Animation

## 4:00 pm

Attendees: Will, Arthur

### Notes

- Will is using DaVinci for editing the video

### Decisions

- we will make the video accessible to deaf people
- all voice-over will be computer-generated and match text displayed on the screen so we are sure that whatever is said comes from displayed text
- we will focus on producing an end-to-end first cut before tweaking details
- we will use 720p as the final video resolution
