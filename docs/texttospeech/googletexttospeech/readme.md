The Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API offers WaveNet voices, which are generated by a deep neural network model trained on raw audio samples of human speech. This results in more natural-sounding and human-like synthetic speech compared to traditional text-to-speech voices.

running the python gttswavenet_lowerdb.py code with argument #1 being the text file

python gttswavenet_lowerdb.py Agraphinwhicheachedgeisassignedadirection.txt

the python script gttswavenet_lowerdb.py reads the text file and calls on the API to produce a mp3 audio file with a slightly reduced amplitude.

The google Wavenet api has limitations on the length of a sentence and an overall character limit.
My estimate of that character limit is 1300.
