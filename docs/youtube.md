I am creating a math explainer video for YouTube. It is for academic purposes. I need to include shorts clips from two other YouTube videos because they make incorrect claims. Your task is to tell me how to download the videos and extract the short clips. I have the YouTube URLs 
  with start times. I know the end times of the clips. My use is fair academic use. The clips are 15 and 12 seconds long.

‚è∫ For academic fair use purposes, here's how to download and extract short clips from YouTube videos:

  Method 1: Using yt-dlp (Recommended)

  Install yt-dlp:
  # Mac (with Homebrew)
  brew install yt-dlp

  # Or with pip
  pip install yt-dlp

  Download and extract clips directly:
  # Extract 15-second clip starting at 2:30
  yt-dlp --download-sections "*2:30-2:45" "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" -o "clip1.%(ext)s"

  # Extract 12-second clip starting at 1:15  
  yt-dlp --download-sections "*1:15-1:27" "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" -o "clip2.%(ext)s"

  For higher quality:
  yt-dlp --download-sections "*2:30-2:45" -f "best[height<=1080]" "URL" -o "clip1.%(ext)s"

  Method 2: Download then Extract with ffmpeg

  Download full video:
  yt-dlp "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" -o "full_video.%(ext)s"

  Extract clips with ffmpeg:
  # 15-second clip starting at 2:30
  ffmpeg -i full_video.mp4 -ss 00:02:30 -t 00:00:15 -c copy clip1.mp4

  # 12-second clip starting at 1:15
  ffmpeg -i full_video.mp4 -ss 00:01:15 -t 00:00:12 -c copy clip2.mp4

  Time Format Notes

  - Use MM:SS or HH:MM:SS format
  - -ss = start time
  - -t = duration (not end time)

  Academic Fair Use Tips

  1. Keep clips minimal - Your 15 and 12 seconds are appropriate
  2. Add context - Clearly explain why you're showing the clips
  3. Cite sources - Include video titles, creators, and URLs
  4. Transform content - Add your analysis/correction

  This approach should work well for your math explainer video showing incorrect claims for educational correction purposes.
